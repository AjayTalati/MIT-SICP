Exercise 1.10
=============

The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermann's function.

```scheme
(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1)
                 (A x (- y 1))))))
```

What are the values of the following expressions?

> (A 1 10)

> (A 2 4)

> (A 3 3)

Consider the following procedures, where `A` is the procedure defined above:

> (define (f n) (A 0 n))

> (define (g n) (A 1 n))

> (define (h n) (A 2 n))

> (define (k n) (* 5 n n))

Give consise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the procedures `f`, `g` and `h` for positive integer values of `n`. For example, `(k n)` computes `5n^2`.

Solution
--------

In the case of the first three expressions, it is worthwhile to work out the evaluation process used by the interpreter to evaluate the expression:

```scheme
(A 1 10)		
(A 0 (A 1 9))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 1 8)))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 7))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 6)))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 5))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 4)))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 3))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 2)))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 1))))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 2)))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 4))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 8)))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 16))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 32)))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 64))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 128)))
(A 0 (A 0 256))
(A 0 512)
1024
```

From this we can see that the expression `(A 1 n)` will evaluate to `2^n`.

For the second expression:

```scheme
(A 2 4)
(A 1 (A 2 3))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 2 2)))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 1))))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 1 2)))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 0 (A 1 1))))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 0 2)))
(A 1 (A 1 4))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 1 3)))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 2))))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 1)))))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 2))))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 0 4)))
(A 1 (A 0 8))
(A 1 16)	;; &lt;-- based on previous example, this expression will evaluate to 2^16 
(A 0 (A 1 15))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 1 14)))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 13))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 12)))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 11))))))

(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 1024))))))

(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 4096))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 8192)))

65536
```

The third expression evaluates to the same answer:

(A 3 3)
(A 2 (A 3 2))

Clearly the procedure `A` defines a recursive process.

We can model the evaluation procedure for the function `f` in the following way:

```scheme
(f n)
(A 0 n)
(* 2 n)
```

so that `(f n)` evaluates to `2n`.

The expression `(g n)` evaluates to `(A 1 n)`, which we have already shown is `2^n`.

The expression `(h n)` is a bit trickier. Let's work out a few examples by hand to see if we can discern a pattern.

`(h 1)` is simple enough: it evaluates to `(A 2 1)` which, by the definition of `A`, is simply 2.

Continuing on with increasing `n`:

```scheme
(h 2)
(A 2 2)
(A 1 (A 2 1))
(A 1 2) ;; --&gt; 4
```

```scheme
(h 3)
(A 2 3)
(A 1 (A 2 2)) ;; --&gt; 2^4 = 2^(h 2)
```

```scheme
(h 4)
(A 2 4)
(A 1 (A 2 3)) ;; --&gt; 2^16 = 2^(h 3) = 65536
```

```scheme
(h 5)
(A 2 5)
(A 1 (A 2 4)) ;; --&gt; 2^(h 4)
```

And so the pattern becomes evident: the value of `(h n)` can only be expressed "recursively" in terms of the value of `(h (- n 1))`. 

Or to express it in terms of "standard" infix notation, we world have: `h(n) = 2^(h(n-1))`.

`h(n)` can be expressed as 2^2 for `n` times:

```scheme
h(1) = 2
h(2) = 2^2 = 4
h(3) = 2^(2^2) = 16
h(4) = 2^(2^(2^2)) = 65536
...
h(n) = 2^(2^(2 ... ^2))   ;; &lt;-- where there are n-terms in the exponential expansion of 2
```
