Project 2 - Prisoner's Dilemma
============================== 

A prisoner's dilemma always involves two "game players", and each has a choice between "cooperating" and "defecting". If the two players cooperate, they each do moderately well; if they both defect, they each do moderately poorly. If one player cooperates and the other defects, then the defector does extremely well and the cooperator does extremely poorly. Before formalizing the prisoner's dilemma situation, we need to introduce some basic game theory notation.

Crash Course in Game Theory
--------------------------- 

In game theory, we differentiate between a *game* and a *play*. A *game* refers to the set of possible choices and outcomes for the entire range of situations. A *play* refers to a specific set of choices by the players, with the associated outcome for that particular scenario. Thus, in game theory, a *two-person binary-choice* game is represented by a two-by-two matrix as above.

The two players in this case are called **A** and **B**, and the choices are called "silent" and "testify". Players **A** and **B** can play a single game by separately (and secretly) choosing either to testify or remain silent. Once each player has made a choice, he announces it to the other player; and the two then look up their respective scores in the game matrix. Each entry in the matrix is a pair of numbers indicating a score for each player, depending on their choices. Thus, in the example above, if Player **A** chooses to testify while Player **B** remains silent, then **A**
