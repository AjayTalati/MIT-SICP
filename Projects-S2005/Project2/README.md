Project 2 - Prisoner's Dilemma
============================== 

A prisoner's dilemma always involves two "game players", and each has a choice between "cooperating" and "defecting". If the two players cooperate, they each do moderately well; if they both defect, they each do moderately poorly. If one player cooperates and the other defects, then the defector does extremely well and the cooperator does extremely poorly. Before formalizing the prisoner's dilemma situation, we need to introduce some basic game theory notation.

Crash Course in Game Theory
--------------------------- 

In game theory, we differentiate between a *game* and a *play*. A *game* refers to the set of possible choices and outcomes for the entire range of situations. A *play* refers to a specific set of choices by the players, with the associated outcome for that particular scenario. Thus, in game theory, a *two-person binary-choice* game is represented by a two-by-two matrix as above.
