;; PROBLEM 3
;;
;; Calculate flight times.
;; +++++++++++++++++++++++
;;
;; The polynomial whose roots we are attempting to calculate is:
;;
;; (0.5)*a*t^2 + v*t + x0 = 0
;;
;; which is the equation of motion for a particle moving under constant acceleration a,
;; constant velocity v and initial position x0.
;;
;; In our case, the acceleration is due to gravity (9.8) and is directed downwards
;; (i.e., negative). The initial velocity and position (i.e., elevation) are passed
;; in as parameters to the procedure.
;;
;; If we plot the elevation of the ball versus time, where the time coordinate is
;; used as the abscissa, and the elevation of the ball is used as the ordinate, the
;; "root1" procedure we defined above will give the "left-most" point at which the
;; graph intersects the abscissa (i.e., t-axis), while the "root2" procedure will
;; give the "right-most" point.
;;
;; We are seeking the "right-most" root of this polynomial, since we are seeking the
;; point "forward" in time from where the ball was released, at which the ball strikes
;; the ground (i.e., has elevation 0).
;;
;; For this reason, we will define our procedure using the "root2" procedure.
;;
;; We define the polynomial whose roots we are seeking as the equation of motion above:
;;
(defn time-to-impact [vertical-velocity elevation]
  (root2 (* -0.5 gravity) vertical-velocity elevation))

;;
;; The following unit tests model shooting the ball straight upwards from the ground
;; at various velocities (i.e., elevation = 0 and vertical velocity = 10, 20 and 50 m/s):
;;
(time-to-impact 10 0)
;; ==> 2.041
(time-to-impact 20 0)
;; ==> 4.082
(time-to-impact 50 0)
;; ==> 10.204
