;; Exercise 2.52
;;
;; [WORKING]
;;

;; (a) Add some segments to the primitive wave painter of exercise 2.49 (add a smile, for example)

;;
;; Let's revisit the information we used to construct the original wave painter:
;;



;; (b) Change the pattern constructed by "corner-split" (for example, by using only one copy of the "up-split" and "right-split" images instead of two)

;; (c) Modify the version of "square-limit" that uses "square-of-four" so as to assemble the corners in a different pattern (for example, you might make the big Mr. Rogers look outward from each corner of the square).
