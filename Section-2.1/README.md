Section 2.1
=========== 

Data Abstractions
----------------- 

In Chapter 1 we looked at computational processes and the role they play in software design:

<ol>
 <li>How to use primitive data (numbers) and primitive operations (arithmetic) to perform computations.</li>
 <li>How to form compound procedures by combining procedures, and by using conditionals and function parameters.</li>
 <li>How to abstract procedures using <code>define</code></li>
</ol>

In this section the focus is on how to build abstractions by combining data to form **compound data**:

<ol>
 <li>Elevate conceptual level at which we can design programs</li>
 <li>Increase the modularity of program design</li>
 <li>Enhance expressive power of language</li>
</ol>

So whereas the focus in Chapter 1 was on how to build abstractions by combining procedures to form **compound procedures**, the focus now will be on how to build abstractions by combining data to form **compound data**.
