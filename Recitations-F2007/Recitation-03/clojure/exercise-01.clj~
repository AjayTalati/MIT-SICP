;; Exercise 1
;;

;;
;; Consider the following definitions:
;;
(defn our-display [x]
  (print x)
  x)

(defn count1 [x]
  (cond (= x 0) 0
        :else
        (do
          (our-display x)
          (count1 (- x 1)))))

(defn count2 [x]
  (cond (= x 0) 0
        :else
        (do
          (count2 (- x 1))
          (our-display x))))

;;
;; What will "(count1 4)" and "(count2 4)" display?
;;

;;
;; These two procedures differ in where they apply the display to console, versus
;; where they apply the recursion.
;;
;; It is useful to work out the call graph for each invocation.
;;
;; Let's start with the call "(count1 4)":
;;

------------------
(count1 4)
------------------
(our-display 4)
(count1 3)
------------------

;;
;; Let's think about what happens here:
;;
;; First we invoke (our-display 4). This procedure will print "4" to the console,
;; and then return the value 4. After the call to (our-display 4) returns, we
;; next invoke (count1 3)
;;

;;
;; What will be displayed on console will be "4", and whatever else will be displayed
;; and returned through a call to (count1 3).
;;

;; Our console thus looks like:
----------------------
4
--> (count1 3)
----------------------
;;
;; Where "-->" signifies an ongoing function evaluation.
;;

;;
;; Let's continue expanding (count1 3), and keep reference of what the console looks like:
;;
----------------------
4
--> (our-display 3)
--> (count1 2)
----------------------
43
--> (count1 2)
----------------------
43
--> (our-display 2)
--> (count1 1)
----------------------
432
--> (count1 1)
----------------------
432
--> (our-display 1)
--> (count1 0)
----------------------
4321
--> (count1 0)
----------------------
43210

;; Since in our clojure implementation, the returned value "0" will be rendered
;; on the same line as the rest of the output.
