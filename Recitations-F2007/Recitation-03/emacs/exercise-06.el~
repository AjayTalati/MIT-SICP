;; Exercise 6
;;
;; Write a procedure that computes the golden ratio, phi.
;;

;;
;; phi can be expressed as the limit of fib(n+1)/fib(n), as n tends to infinity.
;;
;; Knowing this, we can express our procedure for phi using the "fib" procedure as follows:
;;

;;
;; Define the "fib" procedure:
;;
(defun fib (n)
  (cond ((= n 0) 1)
	((= n 1) 1)
	(t
	 (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2))))))
