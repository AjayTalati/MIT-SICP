;; Exercise 4
;;
;; Write a procedure that drops a particular class from a schedule.
;;

;;
;; One way to implement the procedure would be as follows:
;;
(define (drop-class schedule classnum)
  ;; 
  ;; "Temp" class is defined so that we can use the
  ;; procedure "same-class" that is provided in the "API"
  ;;
  (let ((temp-class (make-class classnum '())))

    (define (iter elems)
      (if (null? elems)
	  '()
	  (let ((class (car elems)))
	    (if (same-class? class temp-class)
		(iter (cdr elems))
		(append (list class) (iter (cdr elems)))))))
    (iter schedule)))

;;
;; A more efficient way to implement the "drop-class" procedure would be to use "filter":
;;
(define (drop-class schedule classnum)
  ;;
  ;; "Temp" class is defined so that we can use the 
  ;; procedure "same-class" that is provided in the "API"
  ;;
  (let ((temp-class (make-class classnum '())))

;; The order of growth for the more efficient version of "drop-class"
;; which uses the "filter" procedure is linear in both space and time, 
;; that is, O(n) where n is the length of the list structure "schedule".
;;

;;
;; The order of growth for the less efficient version of "drop-class",
;; the one which does not use the "filter" procedure, is O(n^2) in time.
;; In a worst-case scenario, the procedure must step through each element
;; of the schedule structure, and call the "append" procedure, which 
;; likewise is O(n). The result is a procedure call that uses n(n+1)/2 steps.
;;

;;
;; The order of growth for the less efficient version of "drop-class",
;; the one which does not use the "filter" procedure, is O(n) in space.
;; The procedure uses on copy of the "schedule" data structure as an 
;; argument, and it dynamically builds a second copy of the structure 
;; using recursive calls to append. The result is a procedure call that 
;; requires 2*n units of memory.
